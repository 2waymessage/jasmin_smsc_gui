# Jasmin SMS GUI
As the name implies this application is a web based GUI for the Jookies/Jasmin SMS gateway. As such you will need to have a working installation of Jasmin with the appropriate jcli port (normally 8990) available to the application in order to manage the Jasmin gateway using this application. 

Full documentation for the installation and operation of the Jasmin SMS Gateway can be found at https://docs.jasminsms.com/en/latest/index.html and it is strongly reccomended that you use this documentation when making changes to Jasmin settings.

The application itself is devloped using Py4Web which is a lightweight, fast and and very efficient platform. Documentation for Py4Web including usage and installation can be found at https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/index.html
